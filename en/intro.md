#### Historical Materialism in the 21st century
Through reconstruction of the work and life of Emmy and Roman Rosdolsky, their political formation
amongst early 20th century's Galician radical youth and Red Vienna intellectuals, and their intense
debates with important Marxist thinkers, we aim to a) keep memories of the revolutionary labor movement
alive, and b) emphazise the ongoing relevance of historical materialism in the 21st century.
